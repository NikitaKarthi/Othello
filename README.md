# Othello Game

Othello.py can be run to play a human vs greedy algorithm (computer) game.

The Othello game is further trained using Reinforcement Learning using PPO and A2C models. 

The notebooks PPO.ipynb and A2C.ipynb contain code for both training and evaluating the Othello game using the respective algorithms.
