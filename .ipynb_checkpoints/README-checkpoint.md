# Othello Game

Othello.py can be run to play a human vs greedy algorithm (computer) game.

The Othello game is further trained using Reinforcement Learning using PPO and A2C models. 

The Othello game trained by A2C has a winrate of 0.88 against a random agent.
The Othello game trained by PPO has a winrate of 0.95 against a random agent.

The notebooks PPO.ipynb and A2C.ipynb contain code for both training and evaluating the Othello game using the respective algorithms.
